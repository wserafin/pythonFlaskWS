This is a simple git repository for a learning exercise
I did using Miguel Grinberg's blog post below:

  Grinberg, M,
  2013,
  "Designing a RESTful API with Python and Flask"
  Available at: http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask
  Accessed: 08 September 2015

98% of the code came from Miguel's post and is reproduced
here for learning purposes only (it's my first Python code
and first GitHub repository).
